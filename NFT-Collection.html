        <p class="u-text u-text-1"> Traditional models for scouting, building and connecting with new talent, have always been one sided. Does the A&amp;R think ​you have what it takes? Does the Label think ​you have what it takes?  Does the producer think ​you have what it takes? The true question is: do you think you have what it takes? <br>
          <br>The purpose of this NFT is to de-risk talent discovery, increase knowledge of music publishing, and place power back on the artist. While at the same time, building a community of education on how to navigate the current state of music publishing and where it can head with technologies like NFTs. <br>
          <br>The NFT acts as an A&amp;R and binds the record label and producer to work to help the artist build a single recording. The contract is an equal partnership for the creative control of the composition.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Signed and fully executed contract is unlocked with NFT purchase. Just sign, date and email record label.&nbsp;<br>
